# Conclusion

## Project Summary
The E-Commerce Database System project successfully implemented a comprehensive database solution for an online shopping platform. The system was designed with a focus on scalability, data integrity, and user experience. Key components included user management, product catalog, shopping cart functionality, order processing, and various business rules for discounts, shipping, and taxes.

## Key Achievements
1. **Robust Database Design**
   - Implemented a normalized database schema with 12 interrelated tables
   - Established proper foreign key relationships and constraints
   - Ensured data integrity through CHECK constraints and NOT NULL conditions

2. **Comprehensive User Management**
   - Detailed user profiles with first, middle, and last names
   - Secure password storage and authentication
   - Multiple address support with default address functionality

3. **Advanced Shopping Features**
   - Efficient cart management with quantity controls
   - Flexible order processing system
   - Support for multiple payment methods
   - Comprehensive product catalog with detailed attributes

4. **Business Logic Implementation**
